In this project I am aiming to elaborate and analyses ways to improve customer quality and 
satisfaction including tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy in 
airlines that have impact on customers satisfaction

The solution here is a prediction-based Machine Learning model. It can be implemented by 
different classification algorithms (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision tree, 
XGBoost and so on. Here first we are performing Data pre-processing step, in which Data 
Profiling, feature engineering, feature selection, feature scaling performed and then we are 
going to build model.
